# Phillips Hue

How to setup, configure and interact with the Phillips Hue "smart" lights/lamps.

### Setup

* Purchase or possess atleast one Phillips hue lightbulb [1].
* Install it in a lamp that has the same socket as the lightbulb.
* Purchase or possess the Phillips hue bridge [2].
* Start the bridge as well as download the most recent update.
* **Possible error might occur:** if you first activate the bridge from your PC. The first time this is to be done from the Phillips hue mobile app.
* The Phillips hue bridge should now detect each lamp correctly installed in your home.
